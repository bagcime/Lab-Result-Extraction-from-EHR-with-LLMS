# Lab-Result-Extraction-from-EHR-with-LLMS
This project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structured laboratory result extraction from unstructured Electronic Health Record (EHR) text. It integrates domain-tuned biomedical models (BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, Llama-3, and Qwen-2.5) with a schema-guided JSON extraction
